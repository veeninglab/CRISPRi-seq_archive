# CRISPRi-seq target evaluation alpha
- The file **function_sgRNAefficiency.R** contains a function to find and score all binding sites of a given list of sgRNAs in a given genome.
- The file **library-efficiency.R** contains a script that performs the complete pipeline of target identification and library efficiency analysis. Outputs an Excel table. Calls **function_sgRNAefficiency.R**. 
- The file **library-efficiency-pneumococcal-strains.pdf** contains an analysis of the results of **library-efficiency.R** for seven penumococcal genomes, given the CRISPRi library of this publication. Source code of the pdf: **library-efficiency-pneumococcal-strains.Rmd**.

Requires R packages [CRISPRseek](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CRISPRseek.html) & [biomartr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=biomartr).
